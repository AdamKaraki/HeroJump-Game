# HeroJump-Game
Introducing our new platformer game, Hero Jump! This game combines the thrilling gameplay of Balloon Tower Defense with the classic elements of Mario. Players take on the role of our hero, jumping and running through levels while strategically placing balloons to defend against enemies. The game features retro pixel art graphics, catchy 8-bit music, and a variety of levels with increasing difficulty. With its unique combination of tower defense and platformer elements, Hero Jump offers a fresh and exciting gaming experience. So, it will be a perfect game for those who love both genre of games and looking for a new challenge. <br/><br/>
In Hero Jump, we have implemented the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction - to create a robust and maintainable game structure. Encapsulation is used to hide the internal details of objects and classes, allowing for easy modification without affecting other parts of the game. Inheritance is used to create a hierarchy of classes, where lower-level classes inherit properties and methods from higher-level classes. Polymorphism is used to create a single interface for multiple objects, allowing for easy switching between different game elements. And, Abstraction is used to simplify the game logic and make it easier to understand. All these principles are applied in a way that made it easy to add new features, fix bugs, and make improvements to the game.
